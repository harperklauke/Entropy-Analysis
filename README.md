# Entropy-Analysis

Contains the data and T-tests used for the analysis. Additional criteria checks were used to determine if T-test is applicable. T-tests checks for a siginificant difference between the average entropy values for the 3 different bins: low hair, middle hair, and high hair. Two notebooks were used to separate the tests ( low hair+ middle hair & middle hair + high hair)
